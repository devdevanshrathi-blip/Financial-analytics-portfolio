# Learning Notes

Purpose:
This folder documents my learning journey in finance, analytics,
and risk management with emphasis on practical application.

What will be documented:
- Key financial concepts and formulas
- Mistakes and corrections during projects
- Insights from data analysis and modeling
- Decision-making frameworks used in projects

Rule:
Every concept learned must be linked to either:
1) A calculation
2) A dataset
3) A real financial decision
